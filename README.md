# DIY DIGITISED
## The Client
This application has been produced for Kibworth DIY hardware store, with the aim to help the owner modernise his shop and workflow. Before this solution, all shop sales have to be put through the till but with no record of what specifically has been sold since only the revenue taken is recorded. If any item of the shop is low, this would be found when it has run out and there is no record of incoming products for the store, this is because the owner will often visit car boot/auction fairs and just bring things back for the shop.

## Understanding The Solution
The shop serves customers from the street but it also has a lodger of client accounts. These client accounts are for local businesses who come to Kibworth DIY for products and any sales with these customers are recorded in a 'red book' and an invoice is created. This system will be able to account for sales made by either of these two parties. Furthermore, There are a wide range of products available from items in the shop but also a selection of Coal/Sticks/Logs which can be easily inputted into the system and dealt with. This application will really help Kibworth DIY manage the stock intake/managemet but also help the manage customer accounts.
